# LSTM Architecture

The **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** architecture was introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997. It was developed as an extension of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to address the **Vanishing Gradient problem**. LSTMs utilize a **gated mechanism** to regulate the flow of input information.

## Structure

- **Cell State**: 
  - Acts as long-term memory, which can be modified, added, or removed as needed. 
  - Its purpose is to retain information across multiple time steps.
  
- **Hidden State**: 
  - Represents short-term memory, used to calculate the current output.
  
- **Gated Mechanism**: 
  - Gates are sigmoid functions that control how much information is retained or updated. These include:
    - **Input Gate (\(i_t\))**:
      - Controls how much of the new information is added to the cell state.
    - **Forget Gate (\(f_t\))**:
      - Determines which information from the previous state should be forgotten, thus deciding what to retain.
    - **Output Gate (\(o_t\))**:
      - Decides which part of the cell state is used to calculate the output. After computing the output, it updates the hidden state.

## Utility

- **Long-term memory**:
  - Thanks to the **cell state (\(C_t\))**, LSTMs can retain information over long time intervals, effectively overcoming the Vanishing Gradient problem.
  
- **Flexibility**:
  - The **forget gate**, **input gate**, and **output gate** regulate the flow of information, making the network highly adaptable.
  
- **Versatility**:
  - LSTMs can capture both short-term and long-term relationships in sequential data.
  
- **Applications**:
  - Widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), time series analysis, and speech recognition tasks.
