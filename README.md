# Time-series-analysis---Crypto-asset
This project use Python and Jupyter Notebook to do a comparison between Statistical Models, like ARIMA model, and Deep Learning algorithm, such as LSTM architecture, for Forecasting Bitcoin Crypto Assets

# ARIMA 
ARIMA model is a statistical technique that use Auto Regressive model combine with the Moving Average. The most unique feature of this model it's that introduce a new parameter that rappresent the number of differenation that are needed to make the series starionary.
  ## Library
       -->   Analysis: numpy, pandas, yfinance, 
       -->   Rappresentation: matplotlib, plotly 
       -->   Model implementation: statsmodels, sklearn

# LSTM 
LSTM model is a deep learning technique that ....
