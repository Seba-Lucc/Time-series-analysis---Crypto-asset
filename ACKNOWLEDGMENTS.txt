The project focuses on comparing statistical (ARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM) methods for time series analysis of Bitcoin’s historical prices.

Authors’ Contributions:
	•	[Martina_Butti]: Conducted in-depth research on ARIMA models, including parameter tuning and performance evaluation.
	•	[Sebastiano_Luccheti]: Developed and implemented the LSTM model for the deep learning part of the analysis.
	•	[Sebastiano_Lucchetti]: Debugged the codebase using tools like Visual Studio Code and assisted with integrating various components of the pipeline.
	•	[Team Effort]: Collaboratively prepared the final version of the code, ensuring consistency across both ARIMA and LSTM methodologies, and wrote the documentation.

Tools and Platforms Used:
	•	Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, yfinance, matplotlib, keras, statsmodels, sklearn.
	•	Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code.
	•	Version Control: GitHub.

The project repository contains all relevant materials, including the analysis, models, and documentation, structured to ensure reproducibility and clarity for future studies.
  - We point out that minutes dataset need an accurate selection, while yfinance cancels recursively minutes' datasets 

We express our gratitude to the open-source community and educational platforms that enabled us to deepen our understanding of time series analysis.
**A special thanks to professor Alessandro Bruno for stimulating and supporting us during the entire developing process.**
